Review Comments:

What are the best features of this code?
For these functions, I wrote some comments about the requirements at the function above, and leave it to James to implement it.
James did a very nice job about these two, as it perfectly work as I wish, and cooperate well with my other codes.
The way he dealt with the pegs string, it is new to me. The structure of the code block is reasonable and logical.

Is the code well-documented?
Yes, it is. For every possible doubt point, there are comments.

Is the program decomposition (class and method structure) appropriate?
The structure is good. Maybe the some of the code can be reused and be set as another function.

Does it follow Java code conventions (for example, are methods and variables properly named), and is the style consistent throughout?
Yes. The methods and variables are properly named, and the style is consistent. It is easily understood.

If you suspect an error in the code, suggest a particular situation in which the program will not function correctly.
Part of the code can be reused as some of the code in this two functions are almost the same.
