I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The getDictionary() in class TwistGame, and the functions called during the getDictionary()
* The getSolutions() in class TwistGame, and the functions called during the getSolutions()
* The getViablePiecePlacements() in class TwistGame, and the functions called during the getViablePiecePlacements()

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

The getSolutions() and getViablePiecePlacements() are first implemented by me, and they are working
But we found that it is not fast enough for the getDictionary()
James James Frampton Reid (u6079329) and I decided to optimized it.
So these two are not entirely my own work, it should be James and I's.
